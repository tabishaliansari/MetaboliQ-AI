# About Dataset
  
Gestational diabetes is a type of high blood sugar that develops during pregnancy. It can occur at any stage of pregnancy and cause problems for both the mother and the baby, during and after birth. The risks can be reduced if they are early detected and managed, especially in areas where only periodic tests of pregnant women are available. Intelligent systems designed by machine learning algorithms are remodelling all fields of our lives, including the healthcare system. This study proposes a combined prediction model to diagnose gestational diabetes. The dataset was obtained from the Kurdistan region laboratories, which collected information from pregnant women with and without diabetes.
