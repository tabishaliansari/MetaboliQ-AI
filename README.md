[MetaboliQ AI]()

# Project Abstract -
MetaboliQ AI is an AI-driven healthcare solution targeting diabetes awareness and predicting its occurrences. Comprising of an NLP chatbot and four other functionalities:  
1. Project the number of diabetic patients in a population based on demographics.  
2. Predict individual diabetes risk based on lifestyle.  
3. Classify the type of diabetes using medical reports.  
4. Predict gestational diabetes in women.
  
> By leveraging Machine Learning models, MetaboliQ AI empowers individuals, hospitals, and governments with actionable insights for preparedness to counter this chronic disease and simultaneously raise awareness to reduce health risks.

# Problem Statement -
Diabetes is a proliferating global health problem, with over 830 million people suffering worldwide, the majority living in low-and middle-income countries. Early detection and awareness are important to prevent kidney failure, stroke and heart diseases. Present healthcare technology struggles to predict, classify and manage diabetes cases due to limited resources and large number of patients. MetaboliQ AI addresses this gap through AI-driven healthcare to analyse demographics, lifestyle data and medical reports. By empowering individuals, hospitals and governments; MetaboliQ AI aims at raising awareness among the younger tech-savvy generation and to predict the occurrence of this chronic disease in a given population.

# Solution Description -
MetaboliQ AI is an AI tool which simplifies analysis, prediction and management of diabetes. The tool consists of a chatbot for user education and four predictive functionalities catering to different user types such as individuals, diabetic patients, pregnant women and hospitals. The Machine Learning models provide actionable insights for early detection, precautionary diagnostics and resource planning.  
1.	Population-level diabetes prediction using demographic data.  
2.	Individual risk assessment through lifestyle analysis with a Decision Tree Classifier.  
3.	Diabetes type classification via medical reports using a Random Forest Classifier.  
4.	Gestational diabetes prediction for women using Decision Tree Classifier.  

> The core innovation lies in integrating predictive analytics with accessible tools, enabling governments, hospitals, and individuals to combat diabetes effectively and proactively.
